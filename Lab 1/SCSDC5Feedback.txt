Overall, Lab 1 is complete with minor changes required. Very detailed, however, some of the requirements might be difficult to implement

Functional Requirements: 
[1] 1.1.2 Put as bullet point under 1.1.1
[2] 3.1.1 Put as bullet point under 3.1
[3] 3.5 Error handling can be modelled as alternate flow not a requirement
[4] 4.1 Change filter options into data dictionary
[5] 4.2.1 is the requirement, 4.2 can be removed
[6] 6.4 The system shall provide.....
[7] 9.3 Registerd users must be able to view their search history
[8] 9.4 Dont have to write the opposite, its automatically assumed that guest accounts must not have access when not stated.


Non-Functional Requirements: 
[1] Might want to remove multi-language if not confident of implementing
[2] Most web browsers, better to state which browser and version
[3] Voice command functionality is not found in FR although recommend remove as difficult to implemnent

Data Dictionary: 
1. Correct, No comments

Initial Use Case Diagram: 
1. Use case bubbles should include a verb as the first word of the bubble
2. Add Generalisation arrow to guest as account holder can do whatever a guest can do


Use Case Description: 
1. Alternative Flows should have numbering as well 
For example, AF-2S, 2S represents the second step of [Flow of events] where this alernate flow is diverted from.
2. Exception should have numbering as well
For example: EX-1-2S

UI Mockup:
All UIs match Functional Requirements
