Overall, Lab 2 is complete with some changes required. Please seperate class diagram and stereotyping

Complete Use Case Diagram: 
1. Use case bubbles should include a verb as the first word of the bubble
2. Add Generalisation arrow to guest as account holder can do whatever a guest can do

Use Case Description: 
1. Alternative Flows should have numbering as well 
For example, AF-2S, 2S represents the second step of [Flow of events] where this alernate flow is diverted from.
2. Exception should have numbering as well
For example: EX-1-2S

Boundary Classes Stereotyping
To be assessed together with Class diagram since drawn together

Class Diagram of Entity Classes
1. Methods shouldnt be in boundary object since they shouldnt have logic 
2. remove Attributes as well boundary objects dont store attributes, they should use entities instead
3. Do add <<entity>>, <<control>>, <<boundary>> to your class diagram when you remove the stereotypes

Sequence Diagram
1. For Registration SD, not necessary to have loop
2. Database shouldnt connect straight to Registration Page, should be boundary > control > entity > database
Entity and Database can be swapped depending on which order you are doing

Initial Dialog Map
Naming of the big rectangles shouldnt be system, change to UI or Account Management Component etc.
